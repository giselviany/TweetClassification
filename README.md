# TweetClassification
Classifying Tweets with NLP: Implementing RoBERTa Tokenizer and LSTM.  
●	Classified tweets using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.  
●	Performed multiple text preprocessing steps, including case folding, removal of numbers, punctuation, symbols, and extra spaces.  
●	Applied text representation with the RoBERTa tokenizer.  
●	Built classification models using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.  
●	Optimized the model by adjusting the classification threshold to enhance accuracy.
